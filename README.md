# iiitb_aclock -> Implementation of an Alarm Clock in Verilog applicable in FPGA
This project carries out the design and development of a fully implementable Verilog code of a working digital
alarm clock synthesizable for FPGA. Basic Verilog HDL syntax is
used for the implementation of this digital design and a testbench
file is also created for simulation using the Icarus Verilog compiler
and the GTKWave toolkit.

## Introduction
This design aims to apply the Verilog language into the
development of a simple mechanism of a digital alarm clock. The block diagram for the proposed design is shown below
